# Flukeprint_monitoring
This repository accompanies the study “In the Tracks of a Whale: Thermal Flukeprints Inform on Size and Movement Dynamics.” It contains reproducible R scripts, example datasets, and a synchronized TIR–RGB video illustrating how flukeprint features can be used to estimate whale size, swimming speed, and orientation.
