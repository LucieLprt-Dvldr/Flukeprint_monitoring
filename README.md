### 📘 Overview
This repository contains all R scripts, datasets, and example media used to reproduce the analyses presented in the manuscript:

> *In the Tracks of a Whale: Thermal Flukeprints Inform on Size and Movement Dynamics.*

The analyses include:
- **Size analysis** — estimating size of individuals from flukeprints  
- **Speed analysis** — estimating swimming speed of individuals from flukeprints   
- **Orientation analysis** — estimating headings of individuals from flukeprints

### 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/flukeprint-monitoring.git
   ```
2. Open an R session (≥4.2)
3. Install required packages:
   ```R
    install.packages(c("tidyverse",  "dplyr",  "ggplot2",  "circular",  "CircStats",  "tidyr",  "lme4",  "irr",  "lmtest",  "merTools",  "purrr",  "lubridate",  "caret",  "pROC"))
   ```
4. Run the desired script (e.g., `size_analysis.R`)  
   Each script automatically loads its dataset and reproduces the figures reported in the paper.

### 📊 Example Outputs
- **Figure 4A:** Flukeprint width vs body length  
- **Figure 5A:** Spacing–speed relationship  
- **Figure 6A:** Orientation agreement between TIR and RGB imagery  

Example synchronized RGB–TIR video frames can be accessed in `/example_video`.
